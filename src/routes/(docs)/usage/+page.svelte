<h2>Notice</h2>
<p>
	I kindly ask that you do not make an unreasonable number of requests to the APIs in order to
	ensure the Penylo buisness model is sustainable for everyone. Hosting Penylo isn't free, but
	currently it's not a burden. I would like to keep it that way so I can make it free for everyone.
